  <h1>Welcome to Dash Coffee House!  We're so glad you're here.</h1>
  <p class="story">  
      My passion for coffee has really blossomed over these past few years.  I’ve grown from chain-obedient coffee fiend to honing the craft of coffee roasting & brewing.  
      I wanted to create a space to share my love of all things coffee, wine, & good conversation.   I’ve cried over spilt milk, and beans.  But have loved every step of the journey.  
      <br>I hope you’ll stop in and discover your new spot. 
      <br>Thank you for going on this journey with us.  
      <br>~Team Dash
