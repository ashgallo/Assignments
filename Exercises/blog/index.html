      <h3>Chicago, Stay Home</h3>
        <p>Green Bay begins week 1 in a matchup against the Bears. With the Pack having homefield advantage, Victory Monday is just around the corner.  No one rivals Rodgers & his offensive line.  And the Pack's defense? Good luck Chicago, you might as well stay home.</p>

        <p>2018 marks the 100th season for the Packers.  We've had many reasons for celebration over the years.  From Super Bowl '96 when Desmond Howard scored a 99-yard touchdown.  To the Rodgers to Rodgers Hail Mary of 2015.  Green Bay has some of the most loyal fans out there.  I can't imagine standing behind a better team.  </p>
